# BLUCrits
(yes, I know this is a bad name.)

Made specifically for TitanTF Jailbreak server.

## Pros
- Makes sure mini crits and crits work without damage falloff
- Checks if there is an available Warden (Does not need to wait for Warden Locked message)

## Cons
- Annoying "sparkling" sounds made by the criticals buff
